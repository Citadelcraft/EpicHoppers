## Introduction
EpicHoppers is a powerful hopper plugin that completely revolutionizes the way in which hoppers work. 
The plugin allows you to increase the speed at which items are transferred through hoppers, 
the amount of items that are transferred per tick, 
allows you to wirelessly connect EpicHoppers to chests or other hoppers which decreases the amount of hoppers needed, 
offers a filter system GUI that allows you to transfer, block or delete the items you want 
without needing to set up complicated filter systems with multiple hoppers, 
allows you to teleport between hoppers as an easy transportation system around your base, 
allows you to automatically craft resources such as ingots and minerals into their respective blocks 
(among other things that can be crafted) before sending them into a storage chest, 
allows you to automatically smelt ores into ingots before storing it or transferring it into another hopper, 
allows you to customize the range at which hoppers will pickup items around it, 
allows you to use hoppers to automatically break and transport blocks from generators which leaves you with more time to do other stuff, 
allows you to autosell items in hoppers so you don't run out of storage containers in your base,
and allows you to set up mob hoppers which will automatically kill mobs that come into range of the hopper.

Each of these options can be individually managed for each hopper through the EpicHoppers GUI, 
and server owners are able to customize which features they want players to have access to, 
and lock features behind EpicHopper level restrictions to make it a progressive grind for players to unlock all the powerful capabilities of EpicHoppers.
